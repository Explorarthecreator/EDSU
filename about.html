            <p>Edo State University Uzairue (formerly Edo University Iyamho), was established by the Edo University Uzairue Law (2014) and subsequently amended to Edo University Iyamho, Uzairue, (Amendment Law 2015). It was further amended as Edo University Iyamho (Amendment Law 2016). The University was accorded recognition and issued license by the National Universities Commission on 23rd March, 2016, as the 41st State owned University and 142nd University in Nigeria.</p>

The University is also expected to propel social, economic, political, cultural, scientific and industrial growth of the State and Nigeria. The establishment of theEdo State University Uzairue will equally increase access to tertiary education for Edo State citizens and other Nigerians.
